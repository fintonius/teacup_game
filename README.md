# teacup_game

Building a ball throwing type game for my application to the Founders and Coders bootcamp.
Inspired by my habit of trying to throw a teabag into a cup while I wait for the kettle to
boil!

Have never done anything like this so it's daunting and exciting! This will hopefully teach 
me a lot about javascript and working with HTML's canvas API which I've never used before.
As someone with a background in art and love of animation I'm most excited about getting 
some experience with canvas that I can build on once this project is complete.

The aim of the game is to throw a teabag into a cup. This will require:

    - a user interface to pick the angle of the throw and how hard it is thrown
    - a graphic representation of the teabag and cup
    - a background environment for the game to take place in 
    - a way of determing the distance of the throw
    - a way of determing if the teabag was successfully thrown into the cup
    - a timer to determine when the round ends 
    - a way of throwing multiple teabages in a round until a successful throw is made

Optional extras if time permits:

    - additional levels to play if a throw is successful. These would be incrementally harder
    to complete; e.g the cup gets smaller, cup is further away, some sort of obstacle is introduced
    - a choice of teabag "types"; e.g round, pyramid/triangle, square
    - different environments for the extra levels
    - an animation of a kettle boiling to indicate the timer running down. Will "click" when
    time is up!

Some ideas on how to achieve the above:

    - user's mouse position to determine angle of throw
    - user can 'click & drag' to determine strength of throw
